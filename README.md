# MiscCodeChallenges
A couple of code challenges.

===========
Included in this Repo:

- spiralArray
Creating a spiral array from a provided size number, e.g.
`spiralArray(3)` would result in:
```
[1,2,3],
[8,9,4],
[7,6,5]]
```

- nextVersion
When provided with a "version" of something, e.g. `1.3.4.9`, increment the version by one, carrying over any excess (all values except the first cannot be higher than 9)
e.g.
"1.3.4.9" -> "1.3.5.0"
"10.8" -> "10.9"
"1" -> "2"
"0.9.9" -> "1.0.0"
